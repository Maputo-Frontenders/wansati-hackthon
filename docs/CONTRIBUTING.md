# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome all contributions and appreciate your time and effort. Please take a moment to read and follow these guidelines before you get started.

## Getting Started
To get started with contributing to our project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running yarn install.
3. Create a new branch based on develop branch for your changes. The branch name should start with one of the following prefixes, depending on the type of changes you are making:
    - <strong>feat/</strong> for new features
    - <strong>fix/</strong> for bug fixes
    - <strong>docs/</strong> for documentation changes
    - <strong>style/</strong> for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g. formatting)
    - <strong>refactor/</strong> for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
    - <strong>perf/</strong> for code changes that improve performance
    - <strong>test/</strong> for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
4. Make your changes and commit them using Conventional Commits.
5. Push your changes to the main repository.
6. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the develop branch.

## Conventional Commits
We use Conventional Commits to standardize our commit messages. Please follow the guidelines below when making your commits:

1. Use the following format for your commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
2. The <type> must be one of the following:
    - <strong>feat</strong>: a new feature
    - <strong>fix</strong>: a bug fix
    - <strong>docs</strong>: documentation changes
    - <strong>style</strong>: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g. formatting)
    - <strong>refactor</strong>: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
    - <strong>perf</strong>: code changes that improve performance
    - <strong>test</strong>: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
3. The `<scope>` is optional and should be used to specify which part of the project your commit affects.
4. The `<subject>` should be a short description of the change.


## Code Style
We use Tailwind CSS for our styling and NextJS for our frontend development. Please follow these guidelines when writing your code:

1. Use Tailwind CSS for styling whenever possible.
2. Follow the NextJS documentation for code style and structure.
